## About me
Hi! I am Mark, self-taught freelance data analyst and tennis palyer. I am currently a student at Ain Shams University specialized in Computer Engineering. Since 2020, I have been enrolling in courses and udacity nanodegrees and applying what I learned in freelance projects. Playing tennis made me secure my first freelancing gig at the age of 17, for which I analyzed tennis matches and created match stats and visualized them. Since then, I enjoyed combinig my love for sports with my data analysis skills to create sport statstics.

Hobbies: Graphic Design, Video Editing, Reading, Traveling, Chess
